# Origami Robot Notebook

## Learning Objectives

In this notebook you will:
- `List learning objectives here`


## Introduction

> Intro text given by Andrew


## Setup

Just run these cells to make sure we import the correct modules, and everything will work

`Import cell here`


## Getting the Data

> Insert example code on inserting data as arrays via the datascience library (using max speed)

> Then have students fill in scaffolding code to input the rest of the data

`2-3 examples and 3-4 scaffolding problems`


## Visualization

> Decide between plotly (limited version) or the datascience functions

> Show examples of visualization of their own data `3 examples`

> Set up scaffolding for them to write their own code to create visualizations `2-3 scaffolding problems`

> Maybe include interactive widget so that students can explore many features of the data via dropdowns and sliders


## Conclusion

> Summarize what the students did in the notebook and why it matters

## Feedback Form

> Insert feedback form button and description here
