                "If geckos had not evolved, it is possible that **humans would never have invented adhesive nanostructures** (Autumn and Gravish, 2008). Geckos use millions of adhesive setae on their toes to climb vertical surfaces at speeds of over $1 \\frac{m}{s}$. Climbing presents a significant challenge for an adhesive in requiring both strong attachment and easy rapid removal. Conventional pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are either strong and difficult to remove (e.g. duct tape) or weak and easy to remove (e.g. sticky notes). The gecko adhesive differs dramatically from conventional adhesives. Conventional PSAs are soft viscoelastic polymers that degrade, foul, self-adhere and attach accidentally to inappropriate surfaces. In contrast, gecko toes bear angled arrays of branched, hair-like setae formed from stiff, hydrophobic keratin (like your hair or finger nails) that act as a bed of angled springs with similar relative stiffness to that of PSAs. Setae are self-cleaning and maintain function for months during repeated use in dirty conditions. Setae function as an anisotropic (direction dependent) ‘frictional adhesive’ (Autumn et al., 2006a,b) where adhesion force (perpendicular to the surface) requires a proximally directed (pulled to body) shear force (parallel to the surface).\n",
                "\n",
                "The actual structure of the adhesive is hierarchical in nature and extends across the macro-, meso-, micro-, and even nanoscale. The whole hierarchical structure of a gecko, such as the Tokay, includes four feet, each foot with five toes, each toe with approximately 20 rows of lamellae (scansors), each lamella with many setal arrays consisting of thousands of setae, which amounts to approximately 200,000 setae per toe, and each seta consisting of hundreds to 1,000 spatulae at its end with sizes near 200 nm. Over the years since we discovered how geckos stick (Autumn et al, 2000, 2002), many investigators have shown that all levels of the hierarchy contribute to function, not just the nano-sized, spatular split-ends.\n"

As shear force is increased $(F_\\parallel)$, an adhesive force results $(-F_\\perp)$, perpendicular to the surface pulling away from the surface). It has been shown that **the angle of the setal shaft to the surface $(\\alpha)$ must be kept below $30°$ or detachment occurs**. The requirement of shear force to maintain adhesion is an advantage because it provides precise control over adhesion via friction or shear force [(Autumn et al. 2006)](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/209/18/3558/16105/Effective-elastic-modulus-of-isolated-gecko-setal), allowing strong attachment and easy removal.\n",
